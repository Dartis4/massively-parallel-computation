# massively-parallel-computation
Group code projects for the Massively Parallel Computation class. This repo contains our code for each of the basic OTP behaviors in Erlang and our final project. Many of the files in this repository use templates that were provided to us by our professor Lee Barney, however our team filled in these templates with our own code.

## Team Members:
